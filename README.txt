Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?
    
    NPM Package - A package must contain a package.json file 

Node Module - A module must have a folder with a package.json file containing a “main” field, or a folder with an index.js file in it, or a JavaScript file. 

All NPM packages are modules, but not all modules are packages.  

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?
    
    You would publish it to NPM
